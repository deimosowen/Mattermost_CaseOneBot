# Mattermost CaseOneBot

More than just reminders. This robust bot was designed initially for cron-based reminders within your Mattermost team. As it grew, features like duty scheduling, channel invitations, and calendar integrations were incorporated. Enhance your team's productivity and streamline your Mattermost experience with CaseOneBot

## Key Commands

### Reminders
* `!reminder; [cron-schedule]; [message]` - Sets a reminder with the specified message based on the cron schedule.
* `!reminder-remove; [id]` - Removes the reminder with the specified ID.
* `!reminder-list` - Displays a list of all set reminders.
* `!reminder-help` - Shows all available commands for the bot's reminder functionality.

### Duty Scheduling
* `!duty; [cron-schedule]; [user-list]` - Sets a duty schedule. The user-list should be comma-separated.
* `!duty-remove` - Removes the duty schedule for the current channel.
* `!duty-current` - Displays the current duty user for the channel.
* `!duty-next` - Transitions to the next user in the duty list for the current channel.
* `!duty-help` - Displays all available commands for the bot's duty scheduling functionality.

### Invite to Channel
* `!invite; [channel-link/channel-name]` - Invites the user to the specified channel. You can use either a channel link or a channel name.
   Examples:
   - Using the channel name: `!invite; general`
   - Using the channel link: `!invite; https://your-mattermost-server.com/teamname/channels/general`

### Yandex Calendar Integration
* `!calendar` - Initiates the Yandex Calendar integration process. Upon invocation, the user will receive a link to grant the bot access to their Yandex Calendar data.
* `!calendar-remove` - Removes the Yandex Calendar integration for the current user. This action will revoke the bot's permission to access the user's Yandex Calendar.
* `!meet` - Creates a Yandex meeting. Variants:
   - `!meet` - Creates a quick meeting with default settings.
   - `!meet; [user-list]` - Creates a meeting with specified users.
   - `!meet; [user-list]; [meeting title]` - Creates a meeting with a title and specified users.
   - `!meet; [user-list]; [meeting title]; [60m|1h]` - Additionally, set the duration of the meeting using 'm' for minutes or 'h' for hours. Defaults to 15 minutes if no duration is specified.
   -  The `!meet` command also supports alternative syntax to provide flexibility in how meeting details are specified:
      + `!meet Meeting @username1 @username2 @username3`: Creates a meeting titled "Meeting" with specified users and sets the duration. This format allows you to place the meeting title directly after the `!meet` command.
      + `!meet @username1 @username2 @username3 Meeting 15m`: Similar functionality as above, but the meeting title "Meeting" is placed after the user list. This format is useful when you want to list all participants first before specifying the meeting title.

### Jira Time Logging
* `!jira` - Initiates the process for logging work time in Jira using calendar data. Upon using this command, you'll receive a link to a page where you can easily log your hours based on calendar events you've attended. Authentication with Jira is required, but rest assured, your credentials are not stored or logged on our serverâ€”they remain secure on your end.

### Message Forwarding
- `!forward; [id source channel]; [id target channel]; [message]; [thread-message]` - Sets up message forwarding from source to target channel with an optional message and an optional thread message. For more details on tags used in `[message]`, see the [wiki](https://github.com/deimosowen/Mattermost_CaseOneBot/wiki/Tags).
- `!forward-list` - Displays a list of all forwarding configurations.
- `!forward-remove; [id]` - Removes a specific forwarding configuration based on its ID.
- `!forward-help` - Shows all available commands for the bot's forwarding functionality.
